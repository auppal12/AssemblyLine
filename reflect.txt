This milestone was good practice for almost all the topics we did this semester. I am very thankful to our professor who explained the overall functioning of this milestone in class using a diagram. It really helped. Other than that, I think that once we have done ms1 or ms2, we should not have to make changes again in ms1 or ms2 to make ms3 work. For example, my void CustomerOrder::fillItem(Station& station, std::ostream& os) function was working properly for ms2, but I had to make changes to it in order to satisfy ms3 requirements. I was not expecting to update ms2. Again, this is not a big issue or problem as it only improves our debugging skills. But it would be nice to include a line in the instructions saying ms2 function might need to be changed to make ms3 work. Thank You
